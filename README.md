**Deep Learning Research Intern** @ [INRIA](https://www.inria.fr/fr) _(March 2021 - Aug 2021)_ <br>
The project has been developed during the internship under the supervision of [Emanuele Natale](https://www-sop.inria.fr/members/Emanuele.Natale/) and [Andrea Clementi](http://www.mat.uniroma2.it/~clementi/).
The internship aimed at tackling the problem of compressing artificial neural networks via iterative pruning approaches. I reviewed state-of-the-art approaches, devised variants of known methods and designed novel approaches, and extensively validated those methods against known ones.
Iterative pruning methods have been a classical approach for neural network compression since several decades. While earlier methods relied on heuristic arguments, such as assumptions on the Taylor approximation of the loss function, recent approaches have attempted to provide rigorous guarantees by leveraging algorithmic techniques. The project focused on the assessment of the merits and shortcomings of such recent contributions.
The proposed implementation language for the project is the [Julia](https://julialang.org/) language.
  - **_Technologies used:_** Julia, Flux.
